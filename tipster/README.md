# Tipster Corpus 

## Synopsis

The complete Tipster Corpus is comprised of a test collection built at NIST for the TIPSTER project and the related TREC project. The test collection consists of three CD-ROMs of SGML encoded documents distributed by LDC plus queries and answers (relevant documents) distributed by NIST.

The documents in the test collection are varied in style, size and subject domain. The format of all the documents is relatively clean and easy to use, with SGML-like tags separating documents and document fields. There is no part-of-speech tagging or breakdown into individual sentences or paragraphs as the purpose of this collection is to test retrieval against real-world data.
