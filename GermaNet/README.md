# GermaNet 

## Synopsis

GermaNet is a lexical-semantic net that relates German nouns, verbs, and adjectives semantically by grouping lexical units that express the same concept into synsets and by defining semantic relations between these synsets. GermaNet has much in common with the English [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) and can be viewed as an on-line thesaurus or a light-weight ontology.  
The elements and structure of the data are specified in detail in the [https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/ressources/lexica/germanet/description/](Description) on the project page.  

## Data Structure and Format 

The working copy of GermaNet is stored in a database. It contains all the GermaNet data. [https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/ressources/lexica/germanet/data-format/database/](Information on use and datastructure) is Available. Certain special [https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/ressources/lexica/germanet/applications-tools/](Applications) can be used to modify the data.

## Own Research and Usecases

Currently, GermaNet is planned to be used by Fabian Haak in an ESUPOL publication.
