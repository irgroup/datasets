# GIRT4 (German Information Retrieval Testbase)

## Synopsis

The GIRT collection consists of scientific documents, which have been taken from the databases of the IZ; this means that they have been gathered for domain-specific, scientific purposes, are then processed and made publicly available for a fee. The GIRT data is originally German; but the titles, abstracts or content descriptions and the descriptors of most of the recent documents have been translated into English, making international access easier.
