# iSearch v1.0

## Synopsis

iSearch is an information retrieval (IR) test collection to facilitate the evaluation of integrated search, i.e. search across a range of different sources but with one search box and one ranked result list, and describes and analyses a new test collection constructed for this purpose. The test collection consists of approx. 18,000 monographic records, 160,000 papers and journal articles in PDF and 275,000 abstracts with a varied set of metadata and vocabularies from the physics domain, 65 topics based on real work tasks and corresponding graded relevance assessments. The test collection may be used for systems- as well as user-oriented evaluation.

The data set was crawled from the arXiv and from the Danish National Library. The collection also contains approx. 3.5 million citations to complement the document data.
