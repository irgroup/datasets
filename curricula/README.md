# Curricula 

## Synopsis

This dataset is a collection of curricula from LIS (Library and Information Sciences) study programmes of universities in German-speaking countries.
The curricula documents in PDF format contain, among other information, structured data on the individual modules of a programme.
This structured information has been transferred into relational tables in a database.

The database is running on linux2 (`curricula`).

There is also a webapp built with grails for performing CRUD operations on this database. See [here](https://github.com/neumannm/crud-webapp) for source code, and [here](http://ixtrieve.fh-koeln.de/curricula/) for the running app.
