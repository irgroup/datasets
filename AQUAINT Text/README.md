# AQUAINT Text Corpus 

## Synopsis

The AQUAINT Corpus consists of newswire text data in English, drawn from three sources: the Xinhua News Service (People's Republic of China), the New York Times News Service, and the Associated Press Worldstream News Service. It was prepared by the LDC for the AQUAINT Project, and will be used in official benchmark evaluations conducted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The data files contain roughly 375 million words correlating to about 3GB of data. The text data are separated into directories by source (apw, nyt, xie); within each source, data files are subdivided by year, and within each year, there is one file per date of collection.
